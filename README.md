```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details

### Hyprland

The Hyprland configuration is located in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`. It is modular, with different aspects of the configuration split into separate files in `~/.config/hypr/conf/`:

-   `monitors.conf`: üñ•Ô∏è Monitor and display settings.
-   `enviromentalvars.conf`: ENV variables.

-   `windowrules.conf`: Î£∞ Window rules.
-   `snappy-animations.conf`: ‚ú® Animation settings.

### Waybar

The Waybar configuration is in `~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc`, and the styling is in `~/.config/waybar/style.css`. The bar is configured to show:

-   Workspaces
-   Current window title
-   System tray
-   Notifications
-   Clock
-   Network, CPU, memory, and disk usage
-   Audio volume
-   Battery status
-   A lock button

### Rofi

The Rofi configuration is at `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi`. It provides a clean and simple application launcher.

### Alacritty & Kitty

The terminal configurations are at `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` and `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`. They use the "MesloLGS Nerd Font" and have a transparent background.

### Vim & Neovim

The Vim configuration is at `~/.vimrc` and the Neovim configuration is in `~/.config/nvim/`. They include a variety of settings for a better editing experience, such as:
-   Sensible defaults
-   Custom keybindings for easier navigation and window management
-   A custom statusline
-   A function to toggle comments

## üìú Scripts

The `~/scripts` directory contains several useful scripts:

-   `arch-pkgs`: Installs a predefined set of packages for a new Arch Linux installation.
-   `aur-installer`: Installs an AUR helper (yay or paru).
-   `black-installer`: Sets up the BlackArch repository.
-   `chaotic-aur`: Sets up the Chaotic-AUR repository.
-   `firewall`: Configures UFW with sensible defaults.
-   `intel-undervolt`: Undervolts Intel CPUs to reduce heat and improve battery life.
-   `llms`: Downloads and sets up a local large language model.
-   `optimize-network`: Optimizes network settings by changing DNS and disabling Wi-Fi power saving.
-   `pacman-conf`: Applies a custom `pacman.conf` with parallel downloads and other tweaks.
-   `power`: Sets up TLP for power management.
-   `sddm-setup`: Sets up the SDDM display manager with a custom theme.
-   `setup-git`: Helps configure Git and SSH for a new machine.
-   `tty-setup`: Customizes the TTY with a new font and color scheme.
-   `wset` & `wset-backend`: A script to set a wallpaper and apply a new color scheme to the entire system using `matugen`.
-   `ani-cli`: A script to watch anime from the command line.

## üé® Theming

This setup uses `matugen` to generate a color scheme from the current wallpaper. The `wset` script automates this process. When you run `wset`, it will:

1.  Prompt you to select a wallpaper from your `~/Wallpapers` directory.
2.  Set the selected image as your wallpaper using `swww`.
3.  Generate a new color scheme with `matugen`.
4.  Reload Hyprland, Waybar, and SwayNC to apply the new theme.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybindings

The main keybindings are defined in `~/.config/hypr/conf/keybinds.conf`. Here are some of the most important ones:

-   `Super + Enter`: Open Alacritty
-   `Super + Q`: Close the active window
-   `Super + Space`: Open Rofi
-   `Super + [1-9]`: Switch to workspace 1-9
-   `Super + Shift + [1-9]`: Move the active window to workspace 1-9
-   `Alt + H/J/K/L`: Move focus between windows

For a full list of keybindings, please refer to the `keybinds.conf` file.
